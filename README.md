# Azure Bicep Samples

This is a collection of Azure Bicep sample code motivated by my frustration finding working sample code for certain
resources with recent API versions. The Azure documentation isn't always super clear how strings should be formatted, or even things like "where do you get a list of valid timezones to pass to a TimeZone parameter in Bicep?"

I've done the work so you don't have to. If code is in this repository it has been confirmed to be working and deploying, at least at some point. If you find this repository useful please star it so I can gauge interest in this project.

The best way to use this repository is to use the search at the top of GitHub, leave the repo search filter, and add
the resource you're looking for sample code on. For example:

```text
repo:ckabalan/azure-bicep-samples Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults
```
